### Hello, world! 👋

I am a full-stack web developer, passionate about languages, coffee, and creative thinking. With a background in Portuguese teaching and text reviewing, I bring from my previous work experiences skills such as **attention to detail, clear communication both in writen and spoken English**, ease to collaborating with teammates, and eagerness to find solutions to all kinds of problems. I believe that more than 5 years of experience in the education field turned me into a **flexible, fast-learner professional**, which has been surprisingly helpful when it comes to writing code and thinking of strategic solutions to build applications. As a newcomer — both in the tech field and in Berlin — I am finding myself excited to practice my creative side and keep studying new languages — from JavaScript to German. 

I am always up to a good conversation and a cup of coffee, so feel free to send me a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulia-galizoni-caversan/) or at giuliagalizoni@gmail.com ☕️
